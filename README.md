# Repository Description

This repository contains a project created to practice a new skill â€” **CSS Grid**.

## Project Overview

In this project, I worked on a layout designed specifically for a 1920-pixel width. The layout is not responsive and does not adapt to different screen sizes. The focus of this project was to practice using CSS Grid to create a structured design.

## Objectives

- Gain hands-on experience with CSS Grid.
- Create a layout that is fixed at 1920 pixels wide.
- Explore various CSS Grid properties such as `grid-template-rows`, `grid-template-columns`, and `grid-area`.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS (CSS Grid)
